# Task ID: 19
# Title: Task #19: Develop Interactive Prototype for LedgerLY Based on Wireframes
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a high-fidelity, clickable prototype for LedgerLY using Figma or Adobe XD that demonstrates all core user flows including registration/login, onboarding, dashboard navigation, transaction editing, and data export functionality.
# Details:
The prototype should be built upon the wireframes created in Task #18 and adhere to the UI style guide (Task #16) and component library (Task #17). Key implementation requirements:

1. Tool Selection: Use either Figma or Adobe XD for prototype development, ensuring the tool supports interactive elements and sharing capabilities.

2. User Flow Implementation:
   - Registration/Login: Include email/password registration, social login options, and password recovery flow
   - Onboarding: Create step-by-step screens for bank connection, initial preferences setup, and welcome tour
   - Dashboard Navigation: Design interactive navigation between main sections (accounts, transactions, reports, settings)
   - Transaction Editing: Include flows for categorizing, splitting, adding notes, and attaching receipts to transactions
   - Data Export: Demonstrate PDF/CSV export options with customizable parameters

3. Design Principles:
   - Ruthless UI Clarity: Eliminate visual clutter, use clear hierarchy, and ensure each screen has a single primary action
   - Fintech Trust Elements: Incorporate security indicators, verification steps, and professional financial styling
   - Responsive Considerations: Design for both desktop and mobile experiences with appropriate interaction patterns

4. Interactive Elements:
   - Create realistic hover/active states for all clickable elements
   - Implement form validation feedback
   - Include loading states and success/error messages
   - Add micro-interactions that enhance usability (tooltips, progressive disclosure)

5. Deliverables:
   - Complete Figma/XD file with organized pages/artboards
   - Shareable prototype link for stakeholder review
   - Documentation of user flows with screen connections
   - Presentation highlighting key interactions and design decisions

# Test Strategy:
The prototype will be evaluated through a comprehensive testing approach:

1. Stakeholder Review:
   - Schedule a formal presentation with product owners, developers, and key stakeholders
   - Demonstrate each user flow end-to-end
   - Document feedback and required revisions

2. User Flow Validation:
   - Create a test script covering all specified user journeys
   - Verify that every screen has appropriate navigation options
   - Confirm that all interactive elements respond correctly
   - Ensure no dead-ends exist in the prototype

3. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct moderated testing sessions with 5-7 potential users
   - Assign specific tasks covering each core flow
   - Measure completion rates, time-on-task, and error rates
   - Collect qualitative feedback on clarity and trust factors

4. Design Consistency Check:
   - Audit the prototype against the UI style guide (Task #16)
   - Verify consistent use of components from the component library (Task #17)
   - Check color contrast and typography for accessibility compliance

5. Technical Feasibility Review:
   - Review with development team to identify any interaction patterns that may be challenging to implement
   - Document any technical constraints or alternative approaches

6. Acceptance Criteria:
   - All specified user flows are fully navigable without errors
   - Design adheres to established style guide and component library
   - Usability testing shows >85% task completion rate
   - Stakeholders approve the prototype for development handoff
