# Task ID: 17
# Title: Task #17: Create Comprehensive UI Component Library for LedgerLY
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Document and define all reusable UI components needed for LedgerLY's interface, including detailed specifications for dashboard, onboarding, transaction tables, charts, modals, forms, and notification components.
# Details:
The developer should create a comprehensive component library document that includes:

1. **Dashboard Components**:
   - Navigation sidebar/header
   - Summary cards/widgets
   - Quick action buttons
   - Account balance displays
   - Recent activity feeds

2. **Onboarding Components**:
   - Progress indicators
   - Step navigation
   - Welcome screens
   - Account setup forms
   - Verification components

3. **Transaction Table Components**:
   - Sortable/filterable table
   - Transaction row items
   - Pagination controls
   - Search/filter components
   - Export functionality

4. **Chart Components**:
   - Line/area charts for trends
   - Bar/column charts for comparisons
   - Pie/donut charts for distributions
   - Interactive tooltips
   - Legend components

5. **Modal Components**:
   - Confirmation dialogs
   - Detail view modals
   - Settings/preference modals
   - Alert modals
   - Multi-step modals

6. **Form Components**:
   - Text inputs
   - Dropdown selects
   - Date pickers
   - Checkboxes/radio buttons
   - Form validation indicators

7. **Notification Components**:
   - Toast notifications
   - Alert banners
   - Badge indicators
   - Status indicators
   - Loading/progress indicators

For each component, document:
- Component name and purpose
- Key props/parameters
- State management requirements
- Variants/modifiers
- Accessibility considerations
- Example usage
- Dependencies on other components

This task should align with the UI Style Guide created in Task #16, ensuring all components follow the established design system. The component library should be structured to facilitate implementation by the development team and ensure consistency across the application.

# Test Strategy:
The component library documentation should be verified through the following steps:

1. **Completeness Check**:
   - Verify that all required component categories are included
   - Ensure no critical components are missing from any section
   - Confirm that each component has all required documentation fields

2. **Consistency Review**:
   - Check that component specifications align with the UI Style Guide (Task #16)
   - Ensure naming conventions are consistent throughout the document
   - Verify that similar components have similar documentation structure

3. **Technical Accuracy**:
   - Review props/states for technical feasibility
   - Confirm that component interactions are clearly defined
   - Validate that state management approaches are appropriate

4. **Usability Assessment**:
   - Have 2-3 developers review the documentation for clarity
   - Ensure component purposes and usage examples are understandable
   - Verify that implementation guidance is sufficient

5. **Gap Analysis**:
   - Compare component list against wireframes/mockups to identify any missing elements
   - Review against user stories to ensure all functional needs are covered
   - Check for edge cases or specialized components that might be overlooked

6. **Documentation Format**:
   - Ensure the document is well-organized and easily navigable
   - Verify that visual examples or references are included where helpful
   - Confirm the document is in a format accessible to all team members

The component library should be considered complete when it passes all these verification steps and receives approval from both the design and development team leads.
