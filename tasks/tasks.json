The frontend workflow includes linting, testing, building, and deployment to the staging environment. The backend workflow handles database setup, migrations, testing, and staging deployment.\n\nDependabot has been set up for automated dependency management with weekly updates for npm packages in both frontend and backend, grouped updates for development and production dependencies, and automated updates for GitHub Actions workflows.\n\nDeployment configurations have been prepared with commented examples for AWS S3 and Heroku deployment options. Environment configurations for the staging environment have also been added.\n\nRemaining tasks include:\n1. Configuring the actual deployment providers (AWS/Heroku)\n2. Setting up required secrets in the GitHub repository\n3. Configuring notifications for build failures\n4. Testing the complete pipeline with a sample deployment\n</info added on 2025-05-15T02:20:23.506Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-15T02:28:15.481Z>\nThe CI/CD pipeline configuration has been progressing well with GitHub Actions. The initial Terraform configuration for AWS infrastructure has been created to support the deployment targets for our CI/CD pipeline.\n\nThe Terraform project structure has been established with environments and modules to support different deployment stages. For the frontend deployment, an S3 module has been configured with CloudFront distribution to serve static assets securely with HTTPS and custom domain support. An ACM certificate has been set up for SSL/TLS encryption.\n\nThe staging environment has been configured with an S3 backend for state management, integration with the frontend module, and environment-specific variables to support the CI/CD pipeline's deployment to staging.\n\nThe next infrastructure components that need to be created include:\n1. Backend module for ECS/Elastic Beanstalk to host the application services\n2. Database module for RDS to manage persistent data\n3. VPC and networking components for secure communication\n4. AWS Secrets Manager configuration for sensitive information\n\nOnce these infrastructure components are completed, the GitHub Actions workflows will need to be updated with the new infrastructure references to complete the CI/CD pipeline configuration. This will ensure that our automated deployments target the correct AWS resources.\n</info added on 2025-05-15T02:28:15.481Z>\n<info added on 2025-05-15T02:30:13.551Z>\nThe backend infrastructure configuration with Terraform has been successfully implemented to support our CI/CD pipeline.

ECS Fargate module with:\n   - ECS cluster and service configuration for containerized application deployment\n   - Task definition with container settings for resource allocation and environment variables\n   - Application Load Balancer with HTTPS support for secure traffic routing\n   - Security groups for ALB and ECS tasks with appropriate ingress/egress rules\n   - IAM roles for task execution and runtime with least privilege permissions\n   - CloudWatch log group for container logs to enable monitoring and troubleshooting\n\n2. The staging environment configuration has been updated with:\n   - Integration of the backend module with necessary variables for deployment\n   - Outputs for both frontend and backend resources to facilitate CI/CD integration\n   - Environment-specific settings to differentiate staging from other environments\n\nThe CI/CD pipeline is progressing well with the infrastructure components being built incrementally. The next steps in the infrastructure setup include:\n1. Creating a VPC module for networking infrastructure with proper subnets and routing\n2. Implementing an RDS module for database services with appropriate security measures\n3. Configuring AWS Secrets Manager for storing and retrieving sensitive data\n4. Updating GitHub Actions workflows to reference the newly created infrastructure\n5. Adding production environment configuration with appropriate safeguards\n\nOnce these remaining infrastructure components are completed, the GitHub Actions workflows will be updated to deploy to the correct AWS resources, completing the CI/CD pipeline configuration.\n</info added on 2025-05-15T02:30:13.551Z>",
