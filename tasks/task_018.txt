# Task ID: 18
# Title: Task #18: Design Initial Wireframes for LedgerLY Core User Flows
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create low-fidelity wireframes for LedgerLY's critical user journeys including registration/login, bank connection onboarding, main dashboard, and transaction editing interfaces, emphasizing clarity, minimalism, and trust-building design elements.
# Details:
The wireframes should be created using industry-standard design tools (Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD) and include the following key screens:

1. Registration and Login:
   - User registration form with appropriate fields (name, email, password)
   - Password requirements and strength indicator
   - Email verification flow
   - Login screen with forgot password option
   - Two-factor authentication screens (if applicable)

2. Onboarding (Bank Connection):
   - Step-by-step bank connection wizard
   - Bank selection interface
   - Secure credential input screens
   - Connection success/failure states
   - Multi-account selection if user has multiple accounts
   - Clear security/privacy messaging throughout

3. Main Dashboard:
   - Overview section with key financial metrics
   - Account balance summary
   - Income vs. expenses visualization
   - Spending by category charts
   - Recent transactions list (preview of 5-7 most recent)
   - Quick actions menu
   - Navigation to other sections

4. Transaction Management:
   - Transaction list/table with filtering and sorting options
   - Transaction detail view
   - Edit transaction form (category, tags, notes, split transaction)
   - Bulk edit capabilities
   - Search and filter mechanisms

Design Principles to Follow:
- Prioritize clarity: Use ample white space, clear hierarchy, and intuitive layouts
- Embrace minimalism: Remove unnecessary elements, focus on essential information
- Build trust: Include security indicators, clear data handling messaging
- Ensure accessibility: Consider contrast, text size, and touch targets
- Maintain consistency with the UI Style Guide (Task #16)
- Incorporate components from the UI Component Library (Task #17)

Deliverables should include:
- Complete set of wireframes for all specified screens
- User flow diagrams showing the connection between screens
- Annotations explaining key interactions and functionality
- Mobile and desktop versions of critical screens

# Test Strategy:
The wireframes will be evaluated through the following methods:

1. Design Review:
   - Conduct a formal design review with the product team, developers, and stakeholders
   - Verify all required screens and user flows are represented
   - Ensure wireframes align with the UI Style Guide (Task #16)
   - Confirm wireframes incorporate components from the UI Component Library (Task #17)
   - Check that design principles (clarity, minimalism, trust) are properly applied

2. User Flow Validation:
   - Walk through each user journey step-by-step to identify any gaps or dead-ends
   - Verify logical progression between screens
   - Ensure all error states and edge cases are accounted for
   - Confirm that navigation patterns are consistent and intuitive

3. Stakeholder Feedback:
   - Present wireframes to key stakeholders for feedback
   - Document and prioritize suggested changes
   - Iterate on designs based on feedback

4. Usability Testing:
   - Conduct informal usability tests with 3-5 representative users
   - Create simple tasks for users to complete using the wireframes
   - Observe and document any points of confusion or friction
   - Collect qualitative feedback on the overall experience

5. Developer Feasibility Check:
   - Review wireframes with development team to ensure technical feasibility
   - Identify any potential implementation challenges
   - Confirm alignment with planned backend functionality

Acceptance Criteria:
- Complete set of wireframes covering all specified user flows
- Documentation of user journeys and screen connections
- Alignment with UI Style Guide and Component Library
- Positive feedback from stakeholder review
- Validation through initial usability testing
- Sign-off from product owner and development lead
