# Task ID: 8
# Title: Frontend Authentication and User Management
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 16, 17, 18, 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement frontend components for user registration, login, password reset, and account management.
# Details:
1. Create login page with email/password form
2. Implement registration page
3. Build password reset flow
4. Create account settings page
5. Implement JWT token storage and refresh
6. Add authentication state management
7. Create protected route wrapper

Example authentication context:
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect, useContext } from 'react';
import api from '../services/api';

const AuthContext = createContext();

export function AuthProvider({ children }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Check if user is already logged in
    async function loadUserFromToken() {
      try {
        const response = await api.get('/auth/me');
        setUser(response.data);
      } catch (error) {
        console.error('Failed to load user', error);
      } finally {
        setLoading(false);
      }
    }
    
    loadUserFromToken();
  }, []);
  
  async function login(email, password) {
    const response = await api.post('/auth/login', { email, password });
    setUser(response.data.user);
    return response.data.user;
  }
  
  async function register(email, password) {
    const response = await api.post('/auth/register', { email, password });
    setUser(response.data.user);
    return response.data.user;
  }
  
  async function logout() {
    await api.post('/auth/logout');
    setUser(null);
  }
  
  async function resetPassword(token, newPassword) {
    await api.post('/auth/reset-password', { token, newPassword });
  }
  
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider value={{ 
      user, 
      loading, 
      login, 
      register, 
      logout, 
      resetPassword,
      isAuthenticated: !!user
    }}>
      {children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
}

export function useAuth() {
  return useContext(AuthContext);
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication components
2. Integration tests for login, registration, and password reset flows
3. Test form validation
4. Test authentication state management
5. Test protected routes
6. Test error handling for authentication failures
7. Test token refresh mechanism

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Login Page [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a responsive login page with email/password fields, remember me option, and social login buttons.
### Details:
UI Requirements: Clean, minimalist design with company branding; responsive layout for mobile and desktop. Form Validation: Email format validation, password minimum length check, error messages for invalid credentials. UX Considerations: Loading states during authentication, clear error messaging, keyboard navigation support, and auto-focus on email field.

## 2. Develop Registration Page [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build a user registration form with fields for name, email, password, and terms acceptance.
### Details:
UI Requirements: Multi-step form with progress indicator, password strength meter, terms and conditions checkbox. Form Validation: Email uniqueness check, password complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters), matching password confirmation field. UX Considerations: Real-time validation feedback, clear next steps after registration, option to navigate back to login.

## 3. Create Password Reset Flow [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement forgot password functionality with email verification and password reset forms.
### Details:
UI Requirements: Simple request form for email input, secure reset page with new password and confirmation fields. Form Validation: Email existence verification, secure token validation in URL, new password complexity requirements. UX Considerations: Clear instructions at each step, confirmation messages, expiration handling for reset links, and security notifications.

## 4. Build Account Settings Page [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop a comprehensive account settings page for profile management, password changes, and account preferences.
### Details:
UI Requirements: Tabbed interface for different settings categories, profile photo upload, form fields for personal information. Form Validation: Current password verification for sensitive changes, input format validation for phone/email, file type and size validation for uploads. UX Considerations: Unsaved changes warnings, success confirmations, accessible form controls, and responsive design for all device sizes.

## 5. Implement Authentication State Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create a global authentication context to manage user session, protected routes, and token handling.
### Details:
UI Requirements: Loading states during authentication checks, conditional rendering based on auth state, session timeout notifications. Technical Requirements: JWT storage and refresh mechanism, secure token handling, automatic redirection for unauthenticated users. UX Considerations: Seamless re-authentication, persistent login across page refreshes, clear session status indicators, and graceful handling of expired sessions.

## 6. Add Social Authentication Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.5
### Description: Integrate OAuth authentication with popular providers like Google, Facebook, and Apple.
### Details:
UI Requirements: Branded social login buttons, consistent styling with main authentication forms, loading indicators during OAuth process. Technical Requirements: OAuth flow implementation, account linking capabilities, proper error handling for failed social logins. UX Considerations: Clear permissions explanation, streamlined registration for new social users, fallback options if social authentication fails.

## 7. Implement User Session Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5
### Description: Create functionality to handle user sessions including timeout, multiple devices, and session revocation.
### Details:
